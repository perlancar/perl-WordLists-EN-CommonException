# ABSTRACT: Collection of English common exception words

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Common exception words, sometimes called "red words", or "tricky words", or
"sight words", are words that don't quite follow the spelling or phonics rules
but are often found in high frequency in English text [1]. Examples would
include "once", "our", "was", etc. Therefore, children are taught to memorize
these words in early years of learning.

Each school or teacher will probably setup a slightly different list of these
words.

[1] From monsterphonics.com: "The most top 300 high-frequency words make up 65%
of all printed words. Almost half of these are not decodable using phonics. The
result is that around a quarter of the words that children are asked to learn to
read and spell cannot be done so phonetically. It is therefore vital to
explicitly teach the common exception words."
